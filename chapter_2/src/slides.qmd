## Visual politics is not new politics, but "hot" politics

## Question guiding the project

Is color a source of political information that shapes the public's behaviors and attitudes?

## De-mystifying some of the jargon I might use

- Object
  - refers to anything out in the world that we are interacting with
  - here, these objects are political
- Affect $\neq$ emotion
  - refers to the larger state of being
  - emotion refers to consciously labeled reactions
  - valance refers to pre-consciously 
- "Hot Cognition"
  - refers to the idea that some memories and experiences are more accessible or come to the top of the mind quicker.
  - this coincides with memories and experiences that are affect-laden

## Dominant models of information processing

- Implications
  - Refines existing info. processing models to consider pre-conscious influences.
  - Outlines the cognitive processes undergirding how we:
    - have made associations between the colors red and blue with the two parties.
    - form attitudes and behaviors based on less substantive information (e.g., policy stances).

## Study 1

### Motivation of the experiment

- Do we associate the color red with Republicans and the color blue with Democrats?
- Do these associations provide information that the public act on in politics?

### Setup of the experiment

---

#### Background information

- Age
- Education
- Gender Identity
- Sex
- Visual impairments
  - Including colorblindness
- Party Identification

---

#### Treatment

- Three trials

---

::: {#fig-trial-1}

Trial 3
:::

#### Design

- Recruited 1,000 participants from Prolific
- Counterbalance treatment and background information ($\frac{1}{2}$ see treatment first; other $\frac{1}{2}$ see background questions first)
- Within each trial, participants have $\frac{1}{3}$ chance of seeing any given yard sign.
- MouseView.js

### Do people make these associations?

```{r}
#| label: fig-h-2-predictions
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| fig-cap: The partisanship of candidates change depending on the color of the yard sign
#| fig-subcap:

  , x_label = "Party ID"

  , x_label = "Party ID"
  , y_label = "Pr(Vote for candidate)"
  , legend_title = "Treatment"
)
red
blue
```

## Study 2

### Motivation of Study

--- 

> There obviously is a strong association with blue and the Democratic Party and red and the Republican Party. We've seen in some of our testing that specifically MAGA red tends to elicit a slightly stronger association with Republicans/conservatives/Trump than other shades. The rest of color spectrum doesn't seem to have as strong an association, though greens and purples tend to read a little more left, the combination of red, white and blue tends to read a little more right, black and white tends to read a little left, black and red tend to read a little more right, etc.

---

> A lot of decisions are still made on purely gut feelings as opposed to taking a more multi-disciplinary evidence-based approach.

---

- Do these associations have systematic influences on campaign strategy?

### Outcome variable - How much red and blue do campaigns use?

- Collect around 1,000 yard signs from House elections
  - 2016-2024
- Measuring the colors used on a yard sign:
  - Use a machine learning Python Library, `OpenCV`, that reads images and classifies their components.
    - Trained to classify each pixel in the image
    - Classifies it based on BGR value (reverse of RGB)
    - Looks for a range of values around the "Republican red" and "Democratic blue"

from PY.helper import colorDetector

# Define colors to detect

        #** Not defined. Default for colorDetector()
    #* Red
republican_red = [232, 27, 35] # target color
red_lower = [93, 9, 12] # lower end of spectrum for red

# Load gop image to read

### Predictor variable - What is the partisan composition of the district?
- MIT Election Lab data
  - House election results
  - 1970-2020
- Measuring partisan composition of district:
  - Calculate rolling 5-year average of the Democratic party's vote share for each district

### Do campaigns use a different proportion of the colors red and blue based on partisan composition?
