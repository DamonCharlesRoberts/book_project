## Question guiding the project

Is color a source of political information that shapes the public's behaviors and attitudes?

## De-mystifying some of the jargon I might use

- Object
  - refers to anything out in the world that we are interacting with
  - here, these objects are political
- Affect $\noeq$ emotion
  - refers to the larger state of being
  - emotion refers to consciously labeled reactions
  - valance refers to pre-consciously 
- "Hot Cognition"
  - refers to the idea that some memories and experiences are more accessible or come to the top of the mind quicker.
  - this coincides with memories and experiences that are affect-laden

## Dominant models of information processing

```{r}
#| label: sim-visualization

df <- fabricatr::fabricate(
  N = 10000,
  pop = rnorm(n = N, mean = 2, sd = 1),
  sample = rnorm(n = N, mean = 2, sd = 0.5),
  updated = rnorm(n = N, mean = 1.9, sd = 1)
)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-pre-existing-info

ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_density(aes(x = pop)) +
  theme_minimal()
