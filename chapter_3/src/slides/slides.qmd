# Background

::: footer
:::
---

::: {.notes}
- This is a chapter from a larger book project.
- The book addresses the question: 
  - does color convey political information? 
  - does it have pre-conscious effects on information that comes later?

## Key findings from other chapters

::: {.notes}
- Ran a study on prolific
- Counterbalanced questions of attention, age, gender, race, colorblindness, partisan identity, etc.
- Ran three trials that used mousetracking software
- See one of three yard signs in each trial
  - Red, blue, or white yard sign

#| label: fig-associations
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-cap: People associate red yard signs with Republicans and blue yard signs with Democrats
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - Red treatment
#|   - Blue treatment
red <- predicted_prob_bar(
  fitted_model = list_fitted[["h_2"]][["red"]]
  , x_axis = "trial_1_red_stimuli"
)
blue <- predicted_prob_bar(
  fitted_model = list_fitted[["h_2"]][["blue"]]
  , x_axis = "trial_1_blue_stimuli"
  , treatment = "Blue"
)
red
blue
```

::: {.notes}
- Average predicted probabilities from two ordered logistic regressions
- Outcome is the respondent's belief that the candidate was either a Republican, Independent, or a Democrat.
- Read each figure by comparing the same colored bars. 
- Candidates using red yard signs are more likely to be seen as Republican
- Candidates using blue yard signs are more likely to be seen as Democrat

```

::: {.notes}
- The other two trials used less of the primary color and brought in more red or blue
- Do this as a test of the strength of these effects
- See that the results (kind of) weaken.
  - See that these effects weaken for the blue treatment. Much less change for the red treatment. Likely American flag.

::: {.notes}
- After viewing the three trials, participants are asked which of the three yard signs they prefer.
- Make a dichotomous variable of whether or not they like the first trial's yard sign.
- run logistic regressions to see whether votes are explained by the stimuli moderated by partisan identification
- See that there is a low predicted probability of strong Democrats voting for a candidate with a red yard sign.
  - See that the predicted probability of strong Republicans voting for a candidate with a red yard sign is high.
- See that there is a low predicted probability of strong republicans voting for a candidate with a blue yard sign.
  - See that the predicted probability of a strong Democrat voting for a candidate with a blue yard sign is high.

# Question guiding this chapter

- Does color influence whether we talk about politics?

::: {.notes}
- Color seems to hold information about partisan affilations
  - Red = Republican
  - Blue = Democrat
- Unclear what sorts of effects this will have on attitudes and behaviors, though.

# Building a theory of snap-judgment based on politically-relevant visual information

::: footer

## A common language

- Valance: a positive or negative response to an object.
- Affect (or affective state): feeling positive or negative in response to an object.
  - Pre-conscious response
- Emotion: Much more complex labels assigned to affective responses.
  - Often requires some amount of conscious processing to assign an appropriate label.
  - Slower
- Attitudes are an expression of valanced responses to some object [@fazio_2007_sc].

## A cognitive architecture

::: footer
:::

---

1. Memories are stored prior experiences [@cunningham_2021_yup].
  - often encode affective responses
2. Memories are multi-dimensional [@kahana_et-al_2022_ohhum].
3. Sensory and affective information is often encoded in memories [@kensinger_fields_2022_ohhum].
4. Memories are a complex network [@kahana_et-al_2022_ohhum].
  - Interconnected by different bits of information
5. Social groups and hierarchies are reflected in this network  [@santavirta_et-al_2023_n].

::: {.notes}
Scenario.
- At the airport and watching the news
- Someone sits next to you before boarding
- They are wearing a red hat
- You might have one of two reactions
- A small conversation starts up since they see you watching the news.
- You see its a MAGA hat but they tell you they are having a hard time squaring some of their other beliefs with the stances of the party on immigration.
- You may shift your initial impression a bit. Feel more positive or more negative. However, you haven't fully reversed course on that. You have learned something though.

Implications.
- Color has downstream effects on our attitudes towards an object related to politics.
- The degree to which color matters in politics is whether or not it is primed.
