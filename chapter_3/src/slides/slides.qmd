# Background

- Chapter from a larger book project
- Book examines
  - does color convey political information?
    - particularly partisan affiliation

## Key findings from other chapters

# Question guiding this chapter

- Does color influence whether we talk about politics?


# Building a theory of snap-judgment based on politically-relevant visual information

## A common language

- Valance: a positive or negative response to an object.
- Affect (or affective state): feeling positive or negative in response to an object.
  - Pre-conscious response
- Emotion: Much more complex labels assigned to affective responses.
  - Often requires some amount of conscious processing to assign an appropriate label.
  - Slower
- Attitudes are an expression of valanced responses to some object.

## Learning from our psychology and neuroscience friends ðŸ˜Š

- There are a lot of useful things that we can borrow from social and affective neuroscientists and social psychologists

---

1. Memory reflects stored prior experiences with various objects
  - These memories are not just factual recollections of things
    - e.g., the balloon was red.
  - Memories often encode your affective responses to that object.
2. Relatedly, memories are multi-dimensional
3. How we form an attitude with new information (or a combination of it) is by accessing memories that share features in common with the object.
4. Memories are a complex web of prior experiences that have a whole lot of strands connecting them.
5. Social groups and social hiearchies are a dimension that we pay attention to and encode along with a memory.
